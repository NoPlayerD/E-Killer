# E-Killer: The "Totally Not Worth Your Time" Software

## Why are you even here??
You must be a very jobless person, just like me. Or perhaps you’re looking for something to **totally waste your time**, because that’s what this is: a **useless** project that solves **no real problems**. 

Why? Because I was bored and decided to hack around on a school smart board and make something that *no one ever asked for*. You’re welcome, I guess?

## What's E-Killer?

**E-Killer** is a totally unnecessary software designed to help you unlock a smart board without the teacher's permission. It’s an absurd idea that you will probably never use in real life (unless you want to risk getting in trouble for messing with school equipment, but hey, no judgment here).

Basically, this is a USB-powered "key" for smart boards, with the sole purpose of unlocking them. Why? Who knows. It works, but it’s entirely pointless. Like, really pointless. 

### WARNING: 
- This software might get you into trouble if you use it in real life. Not that you should use it in real life. Please don’t use it in real life. 
- It is more of a **proof of concept** than an actual tool. So, don’t expect anything impressive.

## Why did I create this?

Because **why not**? Everyone loves a challenge, and everyone loves doing things that are **completely unnecessary**. There’s nothing more satisfying than writing code that achieves absolutely nothing… except maybe a few giggles. 

So, I thought, “Hey, how about a program that lets me play around with a school smart board?” And thus, **E-Killer** was born. 

## How it works:

1. Install E-Killer as a service to the windows smart board (dont ask me how you'd do that)
2. Prepare your USB drive (shhh.. nobody told you to create the 'killer.ksk' file!)
3. Watch as it unlocks the board (because why not?).
4. Realize you've just wasted your time reading this and proceed to **wonder what you were thinking**.

## Features:

- Unlocks smart boards for absolutely no reason at all.
- Very few security implications (not really, please don’t actually try this in a real school environment).
- Complete and utter nonsense. (Did I mention that?)

## Installation:

1. Download the source code (don’t ask why you need to).
2. Compile it for windows
3. Install it as a service (to the board, i guess?)
4. After preparing your usb device, plug it in
5. Watch in awe as you unlock a useless device that was never meant to be unlocked.

**Disclaimer**: If you end up getting caught, don’t say I didn’t warn you. I’m only here for the laughs.

## Why shouldn't you use this?

- You shouldn’t use this because it’s **illegal** in some places (probably). 
- It doesn’t solve any real problems (seriously, get a hobby).
- You could get into trouble with school admins, and honestly, **that’s not cool**.
- **AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART**: it kill's all services & processes with the given scheme.. not only *'E-Kilit'* services

## Contribute?

Feel free to send your **useless pull requests** if you want to add even more nonsense features. But I can’t promise that I’ll merge them because... well, **this is a pointless project**.

## License

This software is **unlicensed** because honestly, I don’t even care. You can do whatever you want with it. Just don’t sue me if it somehow breaks a smart board or something.

Have fun, if that’s still possible at this point.

Cheers,  
A completely jobless person who had way too much time on their hands.
